#### Course Description

This course is an introduction to investments, including the analysis of corporate investment projects.  We begin with foundational issues such as retirement planning and mortgage calculations.  The next part of the course describes markets, assets, and properties of returns.  We then study  study how to construct efficient portfolios of assets.  The final part of the course pertains to the financial analysis of corporate projects.

Our analysis tool throughout the course will be python.  Python is both more transparent and quicker to write than are spreadsheets, which are conventional for a lot of the topics we will discuss.   Code will be posted at the "Code Binder" link above.

Grades will be based on weekly assignments and a take-home final exam.
