We're going to discuss how markets operate and how investors trade.  We'll discuss different types of orders and how your order is handled once you submit it.  We'll see why borrowing money to invest is called using leverage, and we'll see how and why we might sell things in financial markets that we don't own.  We'll discuss how mutual funds work and how exchange traded funds work, and why exchange traded funds have become increasingly popular.  We'll pay special attention to bond markets, discussing how bonds are issued and traded and why bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
