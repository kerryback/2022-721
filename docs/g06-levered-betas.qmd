## Overview

- Adding debt increases enterprise value because of the tax savings, up to a point.
- Enterprise value is free cash flow discounted at the WACC.
- Debt and interest do not affect free cash flow.
- So adding debt must reduce the WACC.
- The effect is through taxes, not just because debt is cheaper capital.

## If there were no taxes ...

 - WACC = % equity $\times$ cost of equity + % debt $\times$ cost of debt
 - Consider all equity firm that switches to part debt.  Perpetuity model.
 - Example: equity value = enterprise value = $100, so expected free cash flow / cost of equity = $100.
 - Issue riskless debt paying $1 per year in perpetuity at risk-free rate of 5%.

# 
 
- Market value of debt is $1 / 0.05 = $20
- Use $20 to repurchase shares.  Firm is now $80 equity and $20 debt.
- WACC is 0.8 $\times$ new cost of equity + 0.2 $\times$ 0.05.
- Claim: WACC is equal to old cost of equity
  - This means cost of equity rises with leverage to offset use of cheaper debt capital.

# 

- Example: old cost of equity is 11%.
- Claim: 0.8 $\times$ new cost of equity + 0.2 $\times$ 0.05 = 0.11.
- This means new cost of equity is 12.5%.
- Why?
  - All risk piled on $80 of equity instead of $100 means equity risk per dollar is 10/8 of what it used to be.
  - Risk premium should be 10/8 of what it used to be.  
    - Old risk premium was 11% - 5% = 6%
    - New risk premium is (10/8) $\times$ 6% = 7.5%
    - New cost of equity is 5% + 7.5% = 12.5%.

## But there are taxes ...
