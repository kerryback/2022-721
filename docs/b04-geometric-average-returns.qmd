Tesla went down 50% between Nov 2021 and May 2022. 

<br>

It then went up 50% between May 2022 and Aug 2022.

<br>

Were Tesla shareholders back to even?

- For each $100 of Tesla stock, shareholders experienced 
100 → 50 

- and then 50 → 75.

- They lost 25%, even though the average return was zero.

- So, lose 50% and make 50% → lose 25%.  Suppose you 

  - make 50% and then lose 50%? 

  - lose 50% and then make 100%? 

  - make 100% and then lose 50%?

## Geometric Average Return

Given returns $r_1, \cdots, r_n,$ \
the geometric average return is the number $r$ such that

. . .

$$(1+r)^{n}=(1+r_1)\cdots(1+r_{n})$$

. . .

So earning $r$ each period produces the same accumulation as the actual returns $r_1, \cdots, r_n.$

. . .

<br>
We solve for it as

$$r=[(1+r_1)\cdots(1+r_n)]^{1/n}-1$$

#

The geometric average return is **always less** than the arithmetic average return.

## Examples

- make 50% and lose 50% → geometric average is  

. . .

$$\sqrt{1.5 \times 0.5}-1=-0.134$$

- make 100% and lose 50% → geometric average is

. . .

$$\sqrt{2 \times 0.5}-1=0$$

## Averaging continuously compounded returns

- Recall that compounding continuously at rate $z$ means \$1 will grow to $e^z$ in one year.
- If the actual return is $r$, then the corresponding continuously compounded return is $\log (1+r)$, because compounding continuously at rate $\log (1+r)$ means \$1 will grow to $e^{\log (1+r)} = 1+r$.
- If you make 50% and then lose 50%, then the continuously compounded returns are $\log(1.5)$ and $\log(0.5)$ and the average of these is negative.
- If you make 100% and then lose 50%, then the continuously compounded returns are
$\log(2)$ and $\log(0.5)$ and the average of these is zero.
