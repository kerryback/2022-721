## Property, plant, & equipment

- Net PP&E = undepreciated part of historical PP&E cost
- Use tax depreciation schedules
  - Accelerated compared to straight line financial reporting

## Net working capital

- Short-term assets minus short-term operating liabilities
  - Short-term is called "current"
- Inventory plus accounts receivable minus accounts payable

## Invested capital

- Net PP&E plus net working capital
- Equals assets not financed by payables
- $\Rightarrow$ financed by investors (shareholders and lenders)
- Example: Net PP&E = 100, current assets = 30, current liabilities = 10
  - Total assets = 130
  - Invested capital = 120

## Project cash flows

- Cash flow = income minus change in invested capital
- Usual timing
  - Early years = negative cash flows (build up of capital)
  - Middle years = positive cash flows
  - End = either
    - Extra positive cash flow due to wind-down of working capital and salvage value of PP&E
    - Or maybe disposal and/or environmental clean-up costs

## Example

. . .

| Year | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Invested capital | 100 | 70 | 50 | 35 | 0 |
 Income | 0 | 20 | 30 | 20 | 5 |

<br>

| Year | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
 Income | 0 | 20 | 30 | 20 | 5 |
| Change in invested capital | 100 | -30 | -20 | -15 | -35 |
| Cash flow | -100 | 50 | 50 | 35 | 40 |


## Net present value

Discount rate = 10%

. . .

| Year | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Cash flow | -100 | 50 | 50 | 35 | 40 |
| PV factor | 1 | 0.91 | 0.83 | 0.75 | 0.68 |
| PV of cash flow | -100 | 45.45 | 41.32 | 26.30 | 27.32 |
| NPV | 40.39 |  |  | |  |
