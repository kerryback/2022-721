Let's calculate optimal portfolios for
**stocks, treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and gold**
based on historical means and covariances.

We'll look at indices from 1968 and ETFS from 2004.

## Invest in Treasuries?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="100%"}
- An important fact is that the correlation between Treasuries and stocks (and corporates) was positive in the last century and has been strongly negative in this century.
- inflation shocks $\rightarrow$ **positive correlation**
- macro crisis shocks $\rightarrow$ negative correlation
- Treasuries are a **good investment** if they hedge stocks (and corporates) but a bad investment otherwise (due to low average returns).
- So last century data ⇒ short Treasuries
- This century data ⇒ large Treasury investments
