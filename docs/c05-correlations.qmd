# Real Estate 

The reason an investor should consider other asset classes in addition to stocks is **diversification**.

:::: {.columns}

- Diversification is ineffective if assets move exactly together.
- It is more effective when asset returns are less correlated.
- So, correlation of asset classes is a key issue.

Let's look at stocks, Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, and gold over a long time horizon.

. . .

And look at a broader set of assets over a shorter time horizon using ETFs.

## Correlation with Inflation

An uptick in inflation is generally accompanied by falling asset markets.

Is there an asset that hedges inflation - doing better when inflation is high?  

Let's look at stocks, bonds, and gold.

The average real return of an asset is a very different issue than whether it hedges inflation.

. . .

**Asset A** has a higher geometric average real return than **asset B** if, and only if, **asset A** has a higher geometric average nominal return.

. . .

It doesn't matter for this calculation whether A or B hedges inflation.

. . .

So, we're switching topics, but let's look at real returns of stocks, bonds, and gold.
