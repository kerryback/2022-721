## Stock exchanges

- NYSE, Nasdaq, regional exchanges, foreign exchanges are organized as limit order books.
- A limit order is an order with a price specified.
  - Buy at price of x or less
  - Sell at price of x or more
- If not immediately executable, it goes into the "book."
- Market orders are orders to trade "at market," taking whatever price is available.
- Your broker is required to route your executable order to the venue offering the best price.

## Bid-ask spread

- The price on a limit sell order is called an ask or offer price.
- The price on a limit buy order is called a bid.
- The best (lowest) ask and best (highest) bid are called the inside quotes.
- The difference between the best ask and the best bid is called the bid-ask spread or bid-offer spread.

## Example of a limit orer book

The bid-ask spread is 180.02--180.03.


## Institutional trading

- Mutual funds etc. typically execute trades over several days, trading a small amount at a time, to minimize the price impacts of their trades.
- Brokers offer algorithms optimized to minimize price impacts.
- High frequency trading (HFT) is a different kind of automated trading.
- HFTs look for favorable trades in related securities, opportunities that may only exist for only a millisecond and only earn a penny a trade.
- They are by default the "market makers" in modern markets.  

## Internalization and payment for order flow

- Retail orders are primarily executed on  Alternative Trading Systems rather than the limit order book.
- Your broker/dealer may execute your order itself, to earn the bid-ask spread.
- Or your broker may send your order to another institution in exchange for a "kickback" of part of the spread.
- You are nevertheless supposed to get the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO).
