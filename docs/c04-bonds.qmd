## Bonds 

Pay a specified coupon at regular intervals (usually semi-annually).
And pay face value (= par value) at maturity.  Last payment is coupon plus face.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go

year = np.arange(0.5, 10.5, 0.5)
payment = 3*np.ones(10)
payment[-1] += 100

trace=go.Bar(
  x=year,
  y=payment,
)
fig = go.Figure(trace)
fig.update_layout(
    template="plotly_dark",
    title="5-year 6% bond with semi-annual coupons (per $100 face)",

## Treasury Auctions

 - The U.S. Treasury borrows money by auctioning bonds of various maturities at regular intervals.   
 - They solicit bids from primary dealers of the form
"I will buy x bonds at face value if the coupon is at least y."

- Bidders willing to accept low coupons get their bids filled, and the coupon set on all of the bonds is the lowest that will sell the entire issue.

## Treasury Direct

- Individuals can buy bonds at auction via Treasury Direct with simpler bids: 

  - "I want x number of bonds."

- These "noncompetitive" bids are filled first.

- You can also buy bonds at Treasury Direct outside of the auction framework.

## Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)

The face value of a TIPs is adjusted for inflation.

The coupons are a fixed percentage of the face value, so they rise with inflation too.

So the income you get from a TIPS is fixed in constant dollars.


## How Corporates and Municipals are Issued 

- Usually hire an investment bank, who assesses demand from pension funds, insurance companies, brokerages, $\ldots$

- Investment bank advises on the coupon needed to sell the bonds near par.

- Investment bank will distribute. It may guarantee sale to company or make "best efforts."


## Bond provisions

- Companies and also other issuers typically have many different issues outstanding -- issued at different dates with different coupons.

- Bonds may have covenants that, for example,
  - prohibit the issuance of more debt, or
  - require a minimum income-to-interest ratio, etc.
 
- Bonds may also have options for prepayment, at the company's discretion or at investors' discretion.

## Subordination

- Subordinated (junior) means not getting paid in bankruptcy unless all more senior bonds are paid.

- Junior/senior depends on bond provisions, not time of issue.

- All bonds are typically subordinated to any bank debt.

## Municipal bonds

- Municipal bonds in the U.S. are exempt from federal income tax.
- Municipal bonds are also exempt from state income taxes in the state of issue.
- So, NY investors want to hold NY municipals, California investors want to hold California municipals.
- Municipals are issued by states, cities, counties, school boards, fire districts, ...
- Tax increment financing allows limited use of municipal bonds to back private investments: sports stadiums, etc.

## Bond trading

- The bond market is largely an institutional market.  Trades are large and made through dealers.
- Securities dealers are like car dealers
  - Stand ready to buy or sell
  - Try to sell at a higher price than they buy
- An individual can trade bonds through a broker, even one-stop online through a broker/dealer.
- But it is hard to know if you are getting a good price.
- Usually better to invest  through mutual funds or ETFs.


## Asset Backed Securities


- Asset backed securities are bonds that are issued by a trust and are to be repaid from income generated by assets held by the trust.
- A major category is mortgage-backed securities, including those issued by FNMA, GNMA, and FHLMC, better known as Fannie Mae , Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac.
- There are also securities backed by auto loans, credit card receivables, bank loans to companies, and other bonds.
