## Overview

- Adding debt increases enterprise value because of the tax savings, up to a point.
- Enterprise value is free cash flow discounted at the WACC.
  - Adding debt does not change FCF.
  - So adding debt must reduce the WACC.
- The effect is through taxes, not just because debt is cheaper capital.

## Example

- All equity firm
- Issues perpetual risk-free debt with interest payment $X$
- Value of debt is $D=X/r_f$.
- Tax savings per year is $tX$, where $t=$ tax rate.
- Government's claim is reduced by $tX/r_f = tD$.
- Enterprise value is increased by $tD$.

## If there were no taxes ...

- Enterprise value $EV$ is unchanged
- New equity value is $E = EV-D$.
- All risk is now borne by $E$ dollars of capital rather than $EV$, so risk per dollar increases by $EV/E$.
- Risk premium of equity should increase by $EV/E$.
- New cost of equity is 

. . .

$$r_{\text{new}} = r_f + (EV/E) (r_{\text{old}}-r_f)$$

#

- Without taxes, WACC is 

. . .

$$\frac{E}{EV} \left[r_f + \frac{EV}{E}(r_{\text{old}}-r_f)\right] + \left(1-\frac{E}{EV}\right)r_f$$

- This is $r_{\text{old}}$.
- Leverage wouldn't change cost of capital if there were no taxes.

## But there are taxes ...

- With taxes, leverage still increases the cost of equity.
- With risk-free debt as before, all risk is borne by $E$ dollars of capital rather than the old enterprise value.  
- Old enterprise value is the new enterprise value $EV$ minus $tD$.

. . .

$$EV - tD = E + D - tD = E + (1-t)D$$

#

- So risk per dollar of capital rises by a factor of 

. . .

$$\frac{E+(1-t)D}{E}= 1 + (1-t)\frac{D}{E}$$

- So equity risk rises less when there are taxes.
- The reason it rises less is that the IRS shares the risk increase.
- Because equity risk rises less, the WACC falls (straightforward algebra).
- Leverage reduces the cost of capital - up to a point.
