## Overview

- Adding debt increases enterprise value because of the tax savings, up to a point.
- Enterprise value is free cash flow discounted at the WACC.
  - Adding debt does not change FCF.
  - So adding debt must reduce the WACC.
- The effect is through taxes, not just because debt is cheaper capital.


## If there were no taxes ...

- WACC is 

. . .

$$\frac{E}{E+D} r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D$$

- Increasing the debt share substitutes cheaper capital
- Cost of debt will rise as debt share increases
- Cost of equity will also rise as debt share increases
- These effects exactly offset the use of cheaper capital

## But there are taxes ...

- WACC is 

. . .

$$\frac{E}{E+D} r_E + (1-t)\frac{D}{E+D}r_D$$

- As without taxes, increasing the debt share
  - substitutes cheaper capital
  - but makes debt and equity more expensive

- The net effect with taxes is to lower the WACC
