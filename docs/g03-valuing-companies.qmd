[Intrinsic value is an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses.]{style="color:white; font-weight:bold; font-size:200%;"}

# {background-image="images/buffett.png"}

[Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.]{style="color:white; font-weight:bold; font-size:200%;"}
 
## Equity value or enterprise value?

- Can forecast cash flows after net payments to bondholders.
  - These are equity cash flows.
  - Discount at an appropriate rate, given the risk of the stock.
- Or, can forecast total cash flows to shareholders and bondholders.
  - Discount at a blended rate, given equity and debt risk.
  - Present value is enterprise value (debt + equity value).
  - Subtract value of debt to get equity value.

## Equity cash flow

- Subtract interest expense in income statement.
- Forecast how much additional debt will be used in the future and what future interest will be.
- Borrowing money reduces shareholders' contributions to growing invested capital.

## Free cash flow

- Total cash flows to shareholders and lenders is called free cash flow.
- Don't deduct interest expense in income statement.
- Subtract change in invested capital without worrying aobut how much will be funded by debt or equity.
- Taxes will be overstated (because interest reduces taxable income).  Fix that in cost of capital (more later).

## Perpetuities

- A company has no definite ending date, so a perpetuity model is reasonable.
- What cash flow  will be generated next year?
- By how much will it grow each year afterwards?
- If growth is constant at rate $g$, then value of the company today is $c_1 / (r-g)$.
- The could be equity cash flow and equity value or free cash flow and enterprise value.

## Two-stage growth model

- Instead of constant growth beginning next year, forecast cash flows year-by-year for $n$ years.
- Assume constant growth beginning in year $n+1$.
- Terminal value at year $n$ is

. . .

$$\text{TV} = \frac{c_{n+1}}{r-g}$$

- Value of the company today is

. . .

$$\frac{c_1}{1+r} + \frac{c_2}{(1+r)^2} + \cdots + \frac{c_n}{(1+r)^n} + \frac{\text{TV}}{(1+r)^n}$$

## Example

- Forecast cash flows $c_1=100, c_2=150, c_3= 180, c_4=200$.
- Afterward grow at 5% per year forever.
- Required rate of return is 12%.
- $c_5 = 200 \times 1.05 = 210$, so terminal value at year 4 is 
$210/0.07$.
- Company value is

. . .

$$\frac{100}{1.12} + \frac{150}{1.12^2} + \frac{180}{1.12^3} + \frac{200}{1.12^4} + \frac{210/0.07}{1.12^4}$$
