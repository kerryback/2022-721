#
**The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** is a theory from the 1960s that has been taught to MBAs for 50 years.

It is widely used to estimate expected returns to compute discount factors for evaluating corporate investment projects.

. . .

**It does not work empirically.**

# 

The hypothesis of the CAPM is that **the market portfolio is mean-variance efficient**, with borrowing rate = savings rate.

In the usual application in the U.S., the "market portfolio" is the **U.S. stock market**.

. . .

The rationale for mean-variance efficiency is that if each investor chooses a mean-variance efficient portfolio, then each investor holds the tangency portfolio

. . .

â‡’ **market portfolio is the tangency portfolio**

#

**Mean-variance efficiency implies that all alphas are zero** (otherwise we could mean-variance improve).

. . .

With $\alpha > 0$, 
$$r-r_{f}=\beta(r_m-r_f)+\epsilon$$

where $r_{m}$=market return.

. . .

This implies $\bar{r} - r{f} + \beta(\bar{r}_{m}-r_{f})$ or $\bar{r}=r_{f}+\beta(\bar{r}_m-r_{f})$

. . .

$\beta$ > 1 implies **higher risk premium.** \
$\beta$ < 1 implies **lower risk premium.**

**The data don't comply with the theory.**

A simple example is industry returns. Average returns are unrelated to betas.
