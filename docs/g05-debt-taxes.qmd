## How much debt should a company have?

- Companies have a wide range of debt levels.
  - Public companies usually relatively low.
  - Private equity/leveraged buyout funds relatively high.
- What are the pluses and minuses?

## Hold investments and operations constant

Consider a financial structuring with no effect on investments or operations.  For example,
<br>

- Company is going to invest and can issue shares or borrow money.
- Company could issue shares to pay down debt.
- Company could borrow money to repurchase shares.

## Goal is to increase enterprise value

. . .

Anything that increases enterprise value is good for shareholders. Example:

<br>

  - Suppose EV = 300, debt=100, equity=200
  - Suppose we can borrow 20 more to repurchase shares and increase EV to 310.
    - Now debt = 120
    - Equity = 190
    - Shareholders get 20 in share repurchases, so 210 total.

## Government's share

- There are three claims on a company: shareholders, lenders, and the IRS.
- Value of company = enterprise value (debt + equity) + IRS claim.
- Reducing IRS claim will increase enterprise value and therefore benefit shareholders.
- Reducing IRS share is a positive NPV activity just like a good investment project.

## Example

- All equity company with 100 in pre-tax income in perpetuity.  Tax rate is 30%.  Invested capital constant forever.
- Suppose equity value is 500.
- Company issues 200 in perpetual debt @ 5% and repurchases shares.
  - Taxes are reduced by 200 times 5% times 30% = 3
  - PV of tax savings is 3/0.05 = 60.
  - Enterprise value $\rightarrow$ 560.  Shareholders benefit.

## Trade-off theory

<br>

Companies should borrow to get tax savings up to the point that the marginal cost of potential financial distress equals the marginal benefit of tax savings.
