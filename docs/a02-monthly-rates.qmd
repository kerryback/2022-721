## Monthly rates

- If we earn $r_m$ each month, then \$1 will grow in a year to \$$(1+r_m)^{12}$.
- So, the annual return (gain per \$1) is
$r_a = (1+r_m)^{12}-1$.
- We can reverse this to compute the monthly return from the annual return as
$r_m = (1+r_a)^{1/12} - 1$.
- For example, 1\% per month corresponds to
12.68\% per year.
- 12\% per year corresponds to 0.95\% per month.

## Bank rates

- If a bank says it will loan you money at 12% per year with monthly payments, it will charge you 1% per month.
- Bank formula is $r_m = r_a/12$.

## Frequent compounding at bank rates

- 12\% per year compounded monthly at the bank formula implies an annual rate of $1.01^{12}-1 = 0.1268$
- 12\% per year compounded weekly at the bank formula implies an annual rate of $(1+0.12/52)^{52}-1 = 0.1273$
- 12\% per year compounded daily at the bank formula implies an annual rate of $(1+0.12/365)^{365} = 0.12747$
- More frequent compounding $\rightarrow$ higher **effective annual** rate

## Continuous compounding

A useful fact: as $n \rightarrow \infty$,
$$(1+r/n)^n \rightarrow e^r$$

- We say that an annual rate of $r$ compounded **continuously** produces an effective annual rate of $e^r-1$.
- For example, 12\% compounded continuously implies an effective annual rate of $e^{0.12}-1 = 0.12750$.
- Given an effective annual rate of $r_a$, the corresponding monthly compounded rate is $(1+r_a)^{1/12}-1$.
- Given an effective annual rate of $r_a$, the corresponding continuously compounded rate is $\log (1+r_a)$.
