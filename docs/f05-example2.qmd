# 

- The ABC company is considering upgrading some of its equipment to reduce operating costs.  The new equipment would cost $2 million.  
- The operating savings are projected to be $500,000 per year for six years.  
- The new equipment would be in the 5-year MACRS class.  The depreciation rates per year are 20%, 32%, 19.2%, 11.52%, 11.52%, and 5.76%.

#

- The new equipment would be obsolete at the end of six years and have zero value net of disposal costs.
- The existing equipment could be used for another six years.  However, it has no market value: salvage value net of disposal costs would be zero.  It has been fully depreciated.
- The cost of capital is 10%.
- The corporate tax rate is 30%.
