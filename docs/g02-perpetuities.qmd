## Valuing a perpetuity

- What is the value of a constant sequence of cash flows that goes on forever?

. . .

$$\text{PV} = \frac{c}{1+r} + \frac{c}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{c}{(1+r)^3} + \cdots$$

- The value is $c/r$.
- Example: the value of getting $100 forever, starting in one year, when the rate of return is 10%, is $1,000.
- Proof 1: sum of geometric series
- Proof 2: if you invest $1,000 and earn 10%, you can withdraw $100 in a year without depleting your capital, and continue doing so forever.

## Valuing a growing perpetuity

- What is the value of a sequence of cash flows that grows at a fixed rate forever?

. . .

$$\text{PV} = \frac{c}{1+r} + \frac{(1+g)c}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{(1+g)^2c}{(1+r)^3} + \cdots $$

- The value is $c/(r-g)$.
- Example: the value of getting $100 next year and 8% more each year afterwards, when the rate of return is 10%, is 

. . .

$$\frac{100}{0.10-0.08} = \frac{100}{0.02} = 5000$$

#

- Proof 1: sum of geometric series
- Proof 2: if you invest $5,000 and earn 10%, you can withdraw $100 and have $5,400 remaining (8% more than you started with).  
- Your withdrawals can grow by 8% each year because your account balance grows by 8% each year.
