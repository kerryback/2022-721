## Mutual Funds 

- Easy way to get diversification
- Can also perhaps benefit from professional active management

- Can usually invest directly with no need for a brokerage account 

- Over 7,000 U.S. mutual funds $âˆ¼$ number of U.S. stocks

- Mutual funds for stocks, bonds, international stocks, real estate, ...


## Net Asset Value


- NAV (net asset value per share) is calculated daily after close of trading.
- Equals value of portfolio less any expenses not yet paid divided by number of shares outstanding
- Invest money $\rightarrow$ get shares in fund at next end-of-day NAV 
- Withdraw money $\rightarrow$ sell shares at next end-of-day NAV


## Example

- Invest $10,000 Thursday end-of-day NAV = $250, get 40 shares

- \# of shares can be fractional
- Fund $\uparrow$, withdraw $6,000, next end-of-day NAV = $300
  - $6,000 / $300 = 20 shares that are redeemed
  - Still have 20 shares, worth 20 $\times$ \$300 = \$6,000

## Evidence on active funds


- There is some evidence that active fund managers can beat the market before payment of fees.  

- But there is little evidence of extra returns to investors, after payment of managers' fees.

- There is also little evidence of repeat performance, except that the worst funds after fees tend to remain the worst.


## Some U.S. Stock Indexes


- Dow Jones = 30 stocks
- S&P 100 ~ 50% of U.S. stock market capitalization
- S&P 500 ~ 80% of U.S. stock market capitalization
- Russell 1000
- Russell 3000
- Russell 2000 = Russell 3000 excluding Russell 1000, small-cap index
- Wilshire 5000

## How do stock indexes work?

- % change in index is % increase/decrease in total value of companies in the index (except for Dow)

- % change in index does not include dividend return



## Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

- ETFs were invented in 1990. There are now ~ 3,000 U.S. ETFs.

- ETFs are listed on stock exchanges and trade like stocks.  You buy/sell them through your broker.

- Another easy way to get diversification.  And lower fees than mutual funds.

- There are ETFs for stocks, bonds, international stocks, real estate, currencies, commodities

- ETFs calculate NAVs daily, but you do not buy/sell at the NAV.  You buy/sell at the price determined by the market.

## How do ETFs work?

- ETFs are not open to new cash investments.
- Neither can anyone withdraw cash from them.
- They *are* open to exchanges with *authorized participants (APs)*.
  - APs deliver baskets of assets and receive ETF shares when ETF market price is higher than NAV.
  - APs deliver shares and receive baskets of assets when ETF market price is lower than NAV.
  - This activity moves the ETF market price towards NAV.

## Futures based ETFs

- Commodity ETFs generally hold futures contracts on the commodity instead of the physical commodity. 
- An example is USO (U.S. Oil).
- A counter-example is GLD, which holds gold bars.
- There are also ETFs that take positions in stock index futures to deliver
  - multiples (2-to-1 or 3-to-1) of the stock index return (levered ETFs)
  - the negative of the stock index return (inverse ETFs) or multiples of the negative (levered inverse ETFs)



## Transparency of ETF Strategies

- Because of the mechanism for APs to redeem or acquire shares, an ETF's portfolio must be transparent. 

- So, active strategies of the type typical for mutual funds (who only report portfolios quarterly) are not possible.

- Nevertheless, complex strategies are possible.  For example, some ETFs focus on "quality" stocks or "high momentum" stocks or the like (factor ETFs).
