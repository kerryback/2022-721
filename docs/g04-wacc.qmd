## Weighted Average Cost of Capital

. . .

$$ \text{WACC} = \text{% Equity} \times \text{Cost of Equity} $$

$$+ \text{% Debt} \times \text{After-tax Cost of Debt}$$

- After-tax cost of debt:
  - Suppose $100 interest and 30% tax rate
  - Taxes are reduced by $30, so after-tax interest cost is only $70.
  - After-tax cost of debt = debt yield $\times$ (1 - tax rate).

## Example

- A company has perpetual expected earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 76 2/3.
- Interest expense is projected to be 10 forever.
- The company's bond yield is 5%.  
- Market value of the debt is 10 / 0.05 = 200.

# 

- The company's tax rate is 40%.
- Invested capital is expected to be constant forever.
- Required return on equity is 20%.

## Method 1: Discount equity cash flows

- Pre-tax income is 66 2/3.  Taxes are 26 2/3.  Net income is 40.
- Cash flow is 40.
- Equity value is 40/0.2 = 200.
- Company is 50% debt and 50% equity by market value.

## Method 2: Discount free cash flows

- Apply tax rate to EBIT as if there were no interest: taxes = 30 2/3.
- Income = 76 2/3 - 30 2/3 = 46.
- Cash flow = 46.
- WACC is 

. . .

$$\frac{1}{2} \times \text{20%} + \frac{1}{2} \times (1-\text{40%}) \times \text{5%} = \text{11.5%}$$

- Enterprise value is 46/0.115 = 400.
- Subtract 200 debt value to get 200 equity value.
