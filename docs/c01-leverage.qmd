The return, good or bad, on each $1 is amplified.
</p>

## Example

Invest $100,000.  Borrow $50,000.  Buy $150,000 of stocks.

. . .

<br>

 Assets | Liabilities |
| ---    | ---         |
| Stocks 150,000  | Debt 50,000|

| Equity |
| ---    |
| 100,000


- Leverage ratio = assets to equity.
- You are levered 1.5 to 1.


## A Possible Ending to the Story

Suppose the stocks go up 10% and you're charged 2% interest on the loan.

 Assets | Liabilities |
| ---    | ---         |
| Stocks 165,000  | Debt 51,000|

. . .

| Equity |
| ---    |
| 114,000 |

- You made 10% plus one half of (10% minus 2%) $= 0.10 + 0.5(0.10-0.02) = 0.14$
- "one-half"  because you borrowed 50%.

## Conclusion

You make the stock return  plus the fraction borrowed times (stock return minus borrowing rate).

## Another possible ending

- Suppose the stocks fell by 10%.
- You lose 10% plus one half of ($-$ 10% $-$ 2% ).
- So, your loss is 16% on your $20,000 investment.

. . .

 Assets | Liabilities |
| ---    | ---         |
| Stocks 135,000  | Debt 51,000|

. . .

| Equity |
| ---    |
| 84,000 |

## The good and the bad

- You always make the stock return  plus the fraction borrowed times (stock return minus borrowing rate).
- With 50% leverage and a 2% interest charge, 

. . .

$$+10\text{%} \rightarrow +14\text{%}$$

. . .

$$-10\text{%} \rightarrow -16\text{%}$$


## Margin loan rates

- It pays to shop around.
- Interactive Brokers charges 
  - the Fed Funds rate plus 1.5% on the first $100,000, 
  - and falling further after that.
- Oct 1, 2022:
  - Fed Funds rate = 3.08%
  - Prime rate = 6.25%
