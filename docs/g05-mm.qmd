## How much debt should a company have?

- There is a wide range of debt levels.
  - Public companies relatively low.
  - Private equity/leveraged buyout funds relatively high.
- What are the pluses and minuses?

## Hold investments and operations constant

- Consider a financial restructuring with no effect on investments or operations.
- Issue equity to pay down debt or borrow money to repurchase shares.
- Anything that increases enterprise value is good for shareholders.
  - Suppose EV = 300, debt=100, equity=200
  - Suppose we can borrow 20 more to repurchase shares and increase EV to 310
    - Now debt = 120
    - Equity = 190
    - Shareholders get 20 in share repurchases, so 210 total.
