## Short Sales

- It is possible to sell before you buy.

- You need to borrow the asset the want to sell and return it later.

- This is called selling short or going short or shorting.

- Long = own something (asset)
- Short = owe something (liability)

## Example  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2J9s4HMJCY"><img src="images/youtube2.jpg" style="height:0.5in;" align="right"></a>

- Borrow and sell 100 shares of ABC, which is trading at $60
- ABC drops to $40 and you buy back and return the shares (cover the short).  
- You  bought at $40 and sold at $60, so you made $20 per share.
- Risk is that ABC $\uparrow$ and you have to buy back at more than $60


## Relative performance

Strategy: buy CVX and short XOM or oil company index.

## Example

. . .

Invest $10,000.  Buy $10,000 of CVX and short $10,000 of XOM.

. . .

<br>

| Assets | Liabilities |
| ---    | ---         |
| CVX 10,000  | XOM 10,000|
| Cash 10,000  |          |

. . .


| Equity |
| ---    |
| 10,000

#

. . .

Suppose CVX $\uparrow$ 30%, XOM $\uparrow$ 10%

. . .

<br>

| Assets | Liabilities |
| ---    | ---         |
| CVX 13,000  | XOM 11,000|
| Cash 10,000  |          |

. . .


| Equity |
| ---    |
| 12,000

. . . 

<br>
You make the difference in returns on $10,000.

## Stock borrowing fee

- Have to pay stock borrowing fee (usually small).
- Higher for hard to borrow stocks.
- Lending stocks for shorts is a regular business for mutual funds and the like.

## Margin Requirements

- Suppose you have a $100,000 portfolio and you want to add long-short bets like the CVX-XOM example.
- You can add $50,000 long and $50,000 short.
- Fed Reg T: sum of long and short positions cannot exceed twice your equity, when the positions are put on.
- Reg T is for initial margin. Maintenance margin is up to your broker.
- This is a 150/50 portfolio (150% long and 50% short).

## Dividends and interest

- You have to pay the lender dividends paid by the stock.
- Cash proceeds from a short sale are held as collateral.
- How much interest you get on the cash collateral depends on your broker.  Shop around.
